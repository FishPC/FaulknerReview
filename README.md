# Faulkner Comment
Code and data for Storch et al. (*in review*); "Comment: Associations among fish length, dam passage history, and survival to adulthood in two at-risk species of Pacific salmon" 

## R Code
The files listed below (active link) contains code for power simulations presented in Storch et al. (*in review*).  Code and data for all other analyses are available upon request to the corresponding author.

* [FaulknerCmntPwr_chinook.r](https://github.com/FishPC/FaulknerReview/blob/main/readmetest):  this version of the code requires manual adjustment of certain parameters (i.e., "ss.multiplier" and "sims"); future updates will consolidate code and allow for parallel processing.  Also note, at small simulation sizes, output may vary slightly among runs at a given sample size multiplier ("ss.multiplier").
